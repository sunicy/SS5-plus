Since 3.7.1 release a new tool is available for ss5 management: ss5srv is a command line tool 
to query o modifying ss5 online configuration. 

Changes to ss5 online configuration are immediately effective and don't require reload.  Ss5srv 
can write online config to an output file and then used instead of the orginal.
